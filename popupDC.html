			<h5>ABOUT THE SITE:</h5>
			<p>No global network would be complete without a location in the U.S. capital - the seat of the federal government; home to 177 embassies; headquarters of international policy-making bodies and think tanks; and the site of many museums, monuments and cultural institutions. Concentrated study and research in an array of subjects, including American studies, art history, business, environmental studies, history, journalism, metropolitan studies, politics, prelaw, and public policy is enhanced by access to Washingtonâ€™s distinctive intellectual, political, and cultural life. Students learn under the guidance of a world-class faculty, and engage in carefully selected and academically supervised internships with elected officials, government agencies, international organizations, NGOs, museums, media, and more!</p><p>
			Students live and attend class at the Constance Milstein and Family Global Academic Center, which features seminar rooms, an auditorium, reading room, and student lounges and is located just blocks from the White House, the World Bank, and the Smithsonian museums. The center also serves as a venue for dynamic public programming featuring leaders in government, business, and culture as well as notable public figures as part of the Weissberg Forum for Discourse in the Public Square. These events encourage students to discuss topical issues with distinguished speakers and contribute to an academic environment that deepens their understanding of public policy, civic activism, cultural studies, international concerns, green initiatives, media matters, political debates, legal issues and business affairs. A large NYU alumni network also provides personal and professional development opportunities.</p>
			<p>Site is recommended for students majoring in Economics, History, Political Science, and Social Research and Public Policy. </p>
